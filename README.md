## Things TO WRITE IN REPORT
- Summary of the subject .
- Description of the data scraping process (do not hesitate to use diagrams as illustrations)
- Description of the data cleaning process (RAW data format, cleaning/transforming techniques, CLEANED data structure).
- Specify exploratory variables and compute some basic statistics/visualizations.
- Choosing at least 2-3 EDA techniques for explaining your data (see Chapter 4, e.g. Pearson’s correlation vs Chi2 coefficient). Do not hesitate to use techniques that we studied less extensively in this course, e.g. PCA. Explain why you chose these techniques (why do you believe they should be effective on your problem, your cleaned dataset)
- Choose at least 1-2 more advanced visualization techniques for displaying your data (see Chapter 5, e.g. Pearson’s correlation vs Chi2 coefficient). Do not hesitate to use visualization techniques that we studied less extensively in this course. Explain why you chose these techniques (why do you believe they fit the characteristics of your problem)
- Give more complex insights from the data, based on your EDA analysis, and visualization.

- Detailed contribution of each member: 
    -   More precisely, provide a list of the tasks that you performed in order to solve the problem. Distinguish between programming tasks and
analytic tasks.
        - Examples of programming tasks: data scraping for source A; implementing algorithm A, etc.
        - Examples of analytic tasks: proposing our subject, selecting the algorithms to be used to solve this problem, writing parts 1/2/3/4 of the report, writing parts 1/2/3/4 of the presentation, etc.

    - For each task, provide a detailed contribution of each member to this task:
        - e.g.: Programming Task 1- data scraping from source A: member1 Mr X 40% ; member 2 Mrs Y 60% (no more than 2 members /task for programming tasks)...).
        - e.g.: Analytic Task 1– proposing our subject: member1 Mr X 40% ; member 2 Mrs Y 30% ; member 2 Mr Z 30% (can be more than 2 members /task for analytic
    tasks)...)

## Final assignment (29th of December, 2021)
    
Create 1 directory named with group number, upload on the dedicated assignment on Teams:
- Report: PDF file, no more than 15 pages (not included reference pages / first page / table of contents)
- Code: put in a single .zip file, with a readme.txt file explaining your codes structure, how to run the project – if necessary.
- Video demo of your Python code running in a notebook
- Presentation: PDF file, no more than 10 slides. The first slide MUST contain the (recent) pictures of the students in the group, with student’s name/number
